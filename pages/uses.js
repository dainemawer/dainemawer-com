                            Firefox due to my concerns regarding privacy. Brave is a vendor that
                            I am familiar with, however I find it uncomfortable to navigate.

                            editing, Sketch is a great platform for icons, resizing images etc.
                            Sketch has introduced additional features such as prototyping which
                            allows for seamless presentational capabilities and more efficient

                            (Bluetooth Noise Cancelling) headphones. These headphones accompany
                            me to my favourite coffee shops, and are a great investment for
                            travel.

                            <strong>Coffee Machine</strong> - I own a Delonghi / Nespresso
                            machine which has a cappuccino and espresso setting that I probably
                            use too often for my own good.
